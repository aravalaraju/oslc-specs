  <h2>Discovery</h2>
  <p> The RDF <code>oslc_acc:accessContextList</code> property declares the
    whereabouts of an Access Context List resource. The Access Context List
    resource is the object. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Property Name: accessContextList</li>
    <li>Description: URI of Access Context List resource</li>
    <li>Property URI: <code>http://open-services.net/ns/core/acc#accessContextList</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p> This allows the existence and location of an Access Context List resource
    to be declared with an RDF statement like the following (rendered here in
    Turtle): </p>
  <pre class='example'>
@prefix oslc_acc: &lt;http://open-services.net/ns/core/acc#&gt; .
&lt;&gt; oslc_acc:accessContextList &lt;https://a.example.com/acclist&gt; .
    </pre>
  <p>Where such RDF statements might be found is outside the scope of this specification.</p>

  <h2>Access Context</h2>
  <p class='note' title='TO DO'> This entire section has not yet been edited for brevity and to remove duplication. </p>
  <p> A Client that provides services based on resources fetched from a Tracked
    Resource Set Server, may want to control access to those Resources.  It is
    simple enough for a Client to allow some users to
    access these copies, while denying access to other users. </p>
  <p> In order to make it feasible for Clients to offer access control that
    reflects the access control on the Tracked Resource Set Server, a Server can
    define one or more Access Contexts and associate each of its Resources with an
    Access Context. When configuring a Client to work with a particular Server,
    the administrator can query the Server for a list of relevant Access
    Contexts. This allows the administrator to configure access control at the
    level of Access Contexts within a Tracked Resource Set. </p>
  <p> For its part, the Server associates each of its Resources with an Access
    Context, asserted in the representation of each Resource. This lets the Client
    connect access control rules expressed in terms of Access Contexts with the
    resource representations copied from the Server. Adding a resource to an
    Access Context, or removing one from it, changes the RDF representation of the
    resource. Like other changes affecting the RDF representation of the resource,
    this change is reported as a Change Event in the Server's Tracked Resource
    Set. This supports Clients working with Servers whose resources' Access
    Contexts vary over time. </p>
  <p class='note' title='TBD'> <strong>Editor: related to https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/OSLCCORE-82. (img)</strong> </p>
  <p> This set of Access Contexts within a Server can also change over time. Adding
    a new Access Context Client will generally require an administrator to reconfigure
    the Client against that Server. </p>
  <section id='accAssociations'>
    <h2>Associations between Resources and Access Contexts</h2>
    <p> The RDF <code>oslc_acc:accessContext</code> property is used to indicate that a resource
      belongs to an Access Context. The resource is the subject; the Access Context
      is the object. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Property Name: accessContext</li>
      <li>Description: Access Context of the resource</li>
      <li>Property URI: http://open-services.net/ns/core/acc#accessContext</li>
    </ul>
    <p> For example, the RDF statement (in Turtle): </p>
    <pre class='example'>
@prefix oslc_acc: &lt;http://open-services.net/ns/core/acc#&gt; .
&lt;https://a.example.com/defect/2314&gt; oslc_acc:accessContext &lt;https://a.example.com/acclist#alpha&gt; .
  </pre>
    <p> declares the resource <code>https://a.example.com/defect/2314</code> to be in the Access Context <code>https://a.example.com/acclist#alpha</code>. </p>
    <section id='accessContextPredicate'>
      <p> A linked data
        resource that is deemed (by the Server) to be in an Access Context MUST use
        the <code>oslc_acc:accessContext</code> predicate in its RDF representation to
        assert a relation between the linked data resource (subject) and an Access
        Context. </p>
    </section>
    <p> For example, the above RDF statement embedded in the representation of
      resource <code>https://a.example.com/defect/2314</code> asserts that this
      resource is in Access
      Context <code>https://a.example.com/acclist#alpha</code>. The RDF
      representation of a linked data resource in several Access Contexts will have
      multiple such RDF statements; for a linked data resource not in any Access
      Context, there will be none. </p>
  </section>
  <section id='accList'>
    <h2>Access Context List Resource</h2>
    <p> If an Server uses Access Contexts within its resources, the Server MUST
      provide an Access Context List resource. If a Server has more than one Tracked
      Resource Set, it MUST designate an Access Context List resource for each
      Tracked Resource Set; several Tracked Resource Sets MAY share the same Access
      Context List resource. </p>
    <p> The Access Context List resource is intended to be accessed by
      administrator for the purpose of configuring a TRS Client that is working with
      linked data obtained from that Server's Tracked Resource Set. The
      representation of the Access Context resource is itself linked data. </p>
    <section id='ildpGet'>
      <p> The Server MUST support the use
        of the HTTP GET method for the Access Context List resource. The Server SHOULD
        require the use of TLS when making requests to the Access Context List
        resource. The Server SHOULD require authentication for the Access Context List
        resource, and SHOULD allow access only to users with administrative
        privileges. The Server's response MUST support the JSON-LD media type
        (application/ld+json), and MAY support other linked data representations. The
        response SHOULD include an ETag header. </p>
    </section>
    <p> A client uses an HTTP GET request to retrieve a representation of the
      Access Context List resource, specifying JSON-LD as an acceptable format. For
      example: </p>
    <pre class='example'>
GET https://a.example.com/acclist HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/ld+json
Authorization: Basic [missing - admin user credentials]
</pre>
    <section id='accResponce'>
      <p> The response MUST be a
        JSON-LD format string with a node for the Access Context List along with a
        node for each Access Context. The response SHOULD use the simple @graph form
        with a default graph as shown in the example below. The response SHOULD use
        the @context value shown below (i.e., as a boilerplate header), and SHOULD NOT
        use other advanced JSON-LD features, since these can make the response more
        difficult to understand for human readers who only know JSON, and more
        difficult to processed programmatically by scripts without the benefit of a
        full JSON-LD library. The node’s type property gives the type of the node -
        either <code>oslc_acc:AccessContextList</code> or <code>oslc_acc:AccessContext</code>;
        the node’s id property gives the Access Context URI; the title and description
        properties give the title and description, respectively. </p>
    </section>
    <p> Example of a response: </p>
    <pre class='example'>

</pre>
    <section id='uriStability' class='informative'>
      <h2>URI Stability</h2>
      <p> Access Context List and Access Context resources should have stable
        URIs. When Access Context URIs are based on an Access Context List URI with
        the addition of local id in the fragment (e.g., the Access Context
        URI <code>https://a.example.com/acclist#alpha</code> is based on the Access
        Context List URI <code>https://a.example.com/acclist</code>), the Server
        should ensure that each Access Context has a stable local id that is unique
        within the Access Context List. </p>
